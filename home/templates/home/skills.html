                I have over 5+ years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked at both small startups and
                large organizations.
                While I'm a proficient full-stack developer, my expertise is in building scalable backend services
                (API services, stream processing, and async mechanisms).

              <p class="text-justify">
                I love music, dance, reading book, hacking and playing cricket.
                I contribute to open source projects at leisure.
                I would love to pursue challenging opportunities which contribute to a better tomorrow for all of
                us!

                I am a <span class="fw-bold">full stack developer</span>
                with extensive experience in system administration.
                I have played with a lot of tools and toys. However, I would call these my primary skills:

                You can call me a dedicated Python Developer.
                I love all things Python.
                I have 5+ years of working experience with different Python tools and toys.

              <p class="text-justify">
                  I have mostly worked as a backend developer during my career over the past 1-2 years.
                  But I have had my share of front end development too.
                  I am definitely <span class="fw-bold">not</span> a kickass front end ninja but I do know
                  more than enough HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build decent Web UIs and mobile applications.

              <h2 class="fw-bold">Tool Set: </h2>
              <p class="text-justify">
                  I know <span class="fw-bold">git</span> and work on
                  <span class="fw-bold">OS X. </span>
                  I am also a big fan of <span class="fw-bold">Docker</span> and find it a painless solution
                  to develop and deploy my applications.
                  I have working experience with <span class="fw-bold">MySQL</span>,
                  <span class="fw-bold">PostgreSQL</span> and
                  <span class="fw-bold">SQLs</span> as well.
                  I will not only <span class="fw-bold">build</span> your app but also
                  <span class="fw-bold">deploy</span> it to cloud providers like heroku, Digital Ocean, or
                  any VPS.
                  I am a believer in <span class="fw-bold">code quality</span> and follow the best practices.
                  I use <span class="fw-bold">Jetbrains IDEs</span> for optimum productivity and cleaner
                  codes.
                  I believe every developer should write <span class="fw-bold">unit tests</span>
                  before starting to write business logic. BDD and <span class="fw-bold">TDD</span> are my
                  super secret ninja skills against bugs.

              <p class="text-justify">
                  While I am mostly focused on Python, and Javascript, I love learning new technologies and adapt
                  new tools to solve challenging problems. I have decent expertise in these tools too:

              <p class="text-justify">
                  <span class="fw-bold">Redis:</span>
                  I have used it as message queue, cache and data store.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                  <span class="fw-bold">Golang:</span>
                  I am a big fan of itâ€™s concurrency model, simple syntax and a nice standard library.
                  I have written several command line tools in the language.
                  Cross compilation and the go fmt tool is a big plus for me.

                  I have a very keen interest in growth hacking.
                  I try to understand the business process and add values to both customers and the business.
                  I assume ownership and lead by example.
                  I think out of the box and bring novelty to the table.
